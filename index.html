          <h1>BATMAN</h1>
          <p>
            The Batman is the superhero protector of Gotham City, a tortured,
            brooding vigilante dressed as a bat who fights against evil and
            strikes fear into the hearts of criminals everywhere. In his public
            identity he is Bruce Wayne, billionaire industrialist and notorious
            playboy. Although he has no superhuman abilities, he is one of the
            world's smartest men and greatest fighters. His physical prowess,
            technical ingenuity, and tactical thinking make him an incredibly
            dangerous opponent. He is also a founding member of the Justice
            League.

            <h3>BatMobile</h3>
            <p>Probably Batman's greatest killing machine in terms of the sheer number of lethal weapons it comes loaded
              with, the Batmobile is a nice way for the Caped Crusader to skirt his morals through second-hand killing.
              As the most recent iteration from Batman v. Superman proves, this iconic ride has no problem straight up
              blowing away bad guys.</p>

            <h3>Batrangs</h3>
            <p>The go-to-gadget in Batman's arsenal, the Batarang is his most iconic tool -- not to mention one very
              versatile deadly weapon. First appearing way back in 1939's Detective Comics #31, this stylized
              throwing-star can be considered the Dark Knight's first gadget. Nothing more than sculpted metal in the
              shape of a bat, it's also probably the only one of the Caped Crusader's weapons you could easily make at
              home. </p>

            <h3>Power Armour</h3>
            <p>What do you get when you combine Batman with Iron Man? One heck of a suit of armor (and about a gazillion
              trillion dollars). Over the years, Bats has relied on several variations of mechanized armor to take down
              friends and foes alike. The two most famous are the one from Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and
              the film version it inspired in Batman v Superman. </p>

            <h3>Krytonite Ring</h3>
            <p> You never know when you're going to have to punch Superman in the face, a fact that Batman is well aware
              of. Because like any good superhero, the Caped Crusader spends his time figuring out the best ways to take
              down his friends. Which is why, on the off-chance he needs to go toe-to-toe with the most powerful of them
              all, the Caped Crusader always carries around a ring made out of Kryptonite in his utility belt.</p>

          <h1>Cat Women</h1>
          <p>Selina Kyle, also known as Catwoman, is a jewel thief from Gotham City and one of Batman's most-well known
            enemies. Currently portrayed as an orphan who learned to survive on Gotham's streets, Selina took to
            thievery to survive... but determined to do it in style, she learned martial arts and trained extensively to
            perfect her skills in cat burglary. Her criminal activities are often tempered by a reluctant altruism,
            making her an inconstant villain and occasional ally to Batman. She regularly eludes capture by the Dark
            Knight and maintains a complicated relationship which frequently fluctuates between flirtatious to romantic.
